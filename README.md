Roth's Theorem:
This theorem, proved by Szemerédi, states that if you have a large set of positive integers, you will always find at least three numbers in that set that form an arithmetic progression (numbers that follow a constant sequence).

Szemerédi's Theorem:
This theorem generalizes the idea of Roth. It asserts that in any sufficiently large set of positive integers, you can find arithmetic progressions of any length you desire. In other words, there are always
sequences of numbers following a constant rule within large enough sets.
